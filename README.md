# Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio! Here you'll find a collection of my data analysis projects, showcasing my skills and passion for discovering insights.


## About Me

I am an aspiring data analyst with a strong passion for data visualization and interpretation. My goal is to deliver meaningful, data-driven solutions.


## Projects

Explore the following **SQL projects** to get a taste of my data analytic skills:

1. [Hotel_Booking_EDA](hotel_booking_eda.sql): This project presents a macro-level analysis of real hotel booking data for two types of hotels: City and Resort; retrieved from Kaggel by MOJTABA. The original source is from the article Hotel Booking Demand Datasets, 
	written by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief, Volume 22, Feb 2019.
   **My objective** was to explore how both hotels performed between July 2015 - Aug 2017.
   
3. [Ecommerce_Company_Data_Analysis](ecommerce_data_analysis_mysql.sql): This project focuses on a synthetic dataset created to mimic a real-world ecommerce digital marketing company, created by Maven Analytics.
   **My objective** was to explore the company's different sources of website traffic channels, perform multiple A/B testing website analyses, and build sales conversion funnels for specific products.

4. [Covid_Expoloration_EDA](covid_exploration.sql): This project focuses on real COVID-19 data, extracted from OurWorldInData ranging from Jan 2020 - Aug 2022.
   **My objective** was to explore the overall impact COVID had on the global population.
