Explore the following projects to get a taste of my data analysis skills:

1. [Hotel_Booking_EDA](hotel_booking_eda.sql): This project presents a macro-level analysis of real hotel booking data for two types of hotels: City and Resort; retrieved from Kaggel by MOJTABA. The original source is from the article Hotel Booking Demand Datasets,
